# FlightsSearcher
## Language: C++
### Last update: 12/03/2020
This console application program simulates a Flight Search platform which calculates the cheapest price and the fastest you could get from 
one country to another using a BFS (Breadth-Fisrt Search) algorithm on a weighted graph and hash tables which connects the given 
numbered ID to each country with its name. 

## Graphs
### Price-weighted graph
(The price is not accurate, I invented the prices to run the simulation)

### Duration-weighted graph
(The hour durations are not accurate, I estimated them to run the simulation)

## Hash
(The IDs were not given in that order for an specific reason, I randomly selected them)
